What was the key to Magellan's superior results according to Lynch?,"Huge gains in a few huge positions, not diversification across many small positions."

What examples does Lynch give of liquid stocks that still lost money?,"Polaroid (lost 90% in 1973) and Xerox - both were actively traded and easy to sell, but fund managers still lost money by not wanting to get out."

How does Lynch keep track of his investment stories?,He carries large wire-bound notebooks recording important details from quarterly/annual reports plus reasons for buying/selling each stock.

What is Lynch's preference regarding news and stock purchases?,Buying on good news is healthier long-run; wait for proof rather than rumors to improve odds considerably.

What was Lynch's embarrassing discovery about Body Shop?,"He had already bought shares in 1989 and forgotten - it was one of many 'tune in later' stocks in his 1,400-company portfolio."
What impressed Lynch about the Body Shop's expansion approach?,"The company was proceeding carefully and expanding with caution, requiring chairman approval even for proven franchisees' second stores."
What is Lynch's rule of thumb for growth stock pricing?,A stock should sell at or below its growth rate - even fastest-growing companies rarely achieve more than 25% growth sustainably.
How did Lynch compare Body Shop to Coca-Cola valuations?,Body Shop: 30% grower at 40x earnings vs. Coca-Cola: 15% grower at 30x earnings - he preferred the higher growth despite higher multiple.
